## Introduction
In December of 2017 I needed a spreadsheet view in my Objective C project. I looked for a pod in  [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and found this one [https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/SpreadsheetView](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/SpreadsheetView) . I loved the pod but unfortunately it didn't support Objective C. So I had to develop the Objective C version of the project.
